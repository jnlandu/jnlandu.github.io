    <span class="h2 text-danger warning-text">Attention! </span> This chat may not be able to answer all  the questions about me, but it will try to answer as much as possible. 
    Currently it can also chat  about several topics, since it is a bigger model which was trained on larger datasets. 
    This being said, I expect it to hallucinate, that is, generate answers that are exagerated.
    I am working on building a tiny model,fully specialized model on my personal informations, to prevent such behavior.
    For more accurate details about me, feel free to reach out via my
