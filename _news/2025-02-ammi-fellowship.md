I was awarded a fully funded fellowship to mentor and teach young generations of African researchers in Machine Learning, at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, in its Machine Learning Stream. AMMI

is a prestigious program that brings together the brightest minds from across Africa to advance the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning on the continent.

As part of this fellowship, I will be contributing to curriculum development, delivering lectures on advanced machine learning topics, and providing mentorship to promising graduate students. The program emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical applications, preparing students to tackle real-world challenges in their home countries.

This opportunity allows me to give back to the African tech ecosystem while collaborating with world-class researchers and institutions. I'm excited to help shape the next generation of AI leaders who will drive innovation and technological advancement across Africa.

The fellowship runs for one academic year and includes opportunities for research collaboration, conference participation, and building lasting networks within the African AI community.
