I was privileged to attend the African Probability, Information Theory and Computing School in Kigali, Rwanda. I was awarded a fully funded scholarship, including flight tickets and accommodation.


The school brought together researchers, students, and practitioners from across Africa and beyond to explore cutting-edge developments in probability theory, information theory, and computational methods. Over the course of several days, we engaged with world-class instructors through intensive lectures, hands-on workshops, and collaborative research sessions.

Key highlights included:

- **Expert Lectures**: Sessions on advanced probability theory, machine learning applications, and information-theoretic approaches to modern computing challenges
- **Networking Opportunities**: Connected with fellow researchers from universities and institutions across the African continent
- **Practical Workshops**: Hands-on coding sessions implementing probabilistic algorithms and information theory concepts
- **Cultural Exchange**: Experienced the vibrant culture of Rwanda and built lasting professional relationships

The experience was invaluable for advancing my research interests and expanding my professional network within the African academic community. The scholarship opportunity made this transformative experience possible, and I'm grateful for the exposure to cutting-edge research methodologies and international collaboration opportunities.
