I was privileged to attend the African Probability, Information Theory and Computing School in Kigali, Rwanda. I was awarded a fully funded scholarship, including a round-trip  flight tickets and accommodation.


The school brought together researchers, students, and practitioners from across Africa and beyond to explore cutting-edge developments in probability theory, information theory, and computational methods. Over the course of several days, we engaged with world-class instructors through intensive lectures, hands-on workshops, and collaborative research sessions.

Key highlights included:

- **Expert Lectures**: Sessions on advanced probability theory, machine learning applications, and information-theoretic approaches to modern computing challenges
- **Networking Opportunities**: Connected with fellow researchers (see the gallery) from universities and institutions across the African continent and the world. What made this experience even more enriching was the opportunity to meet 
[Ryan O'donnell](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/), earlier on in September 2024, at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), South Africa, Cape Town](https://aims.ac.za), I used his book [Analysis of Boolean Functions](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/analysis/) to learn the basics of Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, for the lecture in Boolean Functions Analysis that I attended taught by  [Jan Hazla](https://jhazla.github.io/).

- **Practical Workshops**: Hands-on coding sessions implementing probabilistic algorithms and information theory concepts
- **Cultural Exchange**: Experienced the vibrant culture of Rwanda and built lasting professional relationships

The experience was invaluable for advancing my research interests and expanding my network within the African academic community and worldwide. The scholarship opportunity made this transformative experience possible, and I'm grateful for the exposure to cutting-edge research methodologies and international collaboration opportunities.
