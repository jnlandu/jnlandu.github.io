I was awarded the prestigious fully funded AMMI scholarship to study Machine Learning at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Senegal.

This intensive 12-month program covers advanced topics in machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on applications relevant to the African continent. The scholarship covers tuition, accommodation, and living expenses, allowing me to fully concentrate on my studies and research.

The AMMI program brings together top students from across Africa and provides world-class education from leading researchers and practitioners in the field. I'm excited to collaborate with peers from diverse backgrounds and contribute to the growing AI research community in Africa.
