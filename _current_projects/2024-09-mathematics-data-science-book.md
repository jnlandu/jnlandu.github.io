I am currently writing a comprehensive book on Linear Algebra for Data Science, combining mathematical theory with practical Python implementations. The book covers fundamental concepts of linear algebra essential for data science applications, including vector spaces, matrices, eigenvalues, singular value decomposition, and their applications in machine learning algorithms.

The book features:
- Theoretical foundations of linear algebra
- Practical Python implementations using NumPy and SciPy
- Real-world data science applications
- Interactive examples and exercises
- Comprehensive coverage from basics to advanced topics
