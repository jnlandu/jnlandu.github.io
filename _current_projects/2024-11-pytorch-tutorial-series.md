I am developing a comprehensive PyTorch tutorial series specifically designed for African researchers and students. The series will cover deep learning fundamentals, practical implementations, and applications relevant to African contexts including agriculture, healthcare, and economic development.

The course will feature:
- Step-by-step PyTorch implementations
- African-focused case studies and datasets
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks
- Video lectures in English and French
- Community support forum
- Certificate upon completion
