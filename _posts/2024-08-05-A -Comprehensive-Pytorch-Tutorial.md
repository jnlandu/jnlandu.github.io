## Introduction to PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework that provides a flexible and dynamic approach to building and training neural networks. Its core features include:

- **Tensors:** Multi-dimensional arrays similar to NumPy arrays.
- **Autograd:** Automatic differentiation for gradient computation.
- **Neural Network Module:** A high-level API for building neural networks.
- **Optimization:** Tools for optimizing and training models.

## Setting Up PyTorch

To use PyTorch, you'll need to install it along with its dependencies. Follow these steps to set up PyTorch:

1. **Install PyTorch**

   Visit the [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and select your configuration (OS, Package Manager, Python Version, CUDA Version). You will get the installation command specific to your setup. For example:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```

2. **Verify the Installation**

   Run the following Python code to ensure PyTorch is installed correctly:

   ```python
   import torch
   print(torch.__version__)
   print(torch.cuda.is_available())
   ```

   The first line prints the PyTorch version, and the second line checks if CUDA (GPU support) is available.

## Basic Tensor Operations

Tensors are the fundamental data structures in PyTorch. Here’s how to create and manipulate tensors.

### Creating Tensors

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor filled with zeros
x = torch.zeros(3, 2)
print("Tensor of zeros:")
print(x)

# Create a tensor filled with random values
y = torch.rand(3, 2)
print("\nTensor of random values:")
print(y)

# Create a tensor from a Python list
z = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print("\nTensor from list:")
print(z)
```

### Tensor Operations

```python
# Basic arithmetic operations
a = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
b = torch.tensor([4, 5, 6])

# Addition
c = a + b
print("\nAddition:")
print(c)

# Element-wise multiplication
d = a * b
print("\nElement-wise multiplication:")
print(d)

# Matrix multiplication
e = torch.matmul(a.view(1, 3), b.view(3, 1))
print("\nMatrix multiplication:")
print(e)
```

### Reshaping and Indexing

```python
# Reshape a tensor
x = torch.arange(9).view(3, 3)
print("\nReshaped tensor:")
print(x)

# Indexing
print("\nElement at position (1, 2):")
print(x[1, 2])

# Slicing
print("\nSlice of tensor:")
print(x[:, 1])
```

## Building Neural Networks

PyTorch’s `torch.nn` module provides the tools to create and train neural networks. Here’s a step-by-step guide to building a simple feedforward neural network.

### Defining the Network

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(2, 5)  # First fully connected layer
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 1)  # Second fully connected layer

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))  # Apply ReLU activation
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleNN()
print("Model architecture:")
print(model)
```

### Forward Pass

```python
# Create a dummy input tensor
input_tensor = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0]])

# Forward pass through the network
output = model(input_tensor)
print("\nOutput of the network:")
print(output)
```

## Training a Model

To train a model, you need to define a loss function and an optimizer. Here’s how to set up and run a training loop.

### Creating a Dataset

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Create some sample data
X = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [2.0, 3.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
y = torch.tensor([[3.0], [5.0], [7.0]])

# Create a dataset and dataloader
dataset = TensorDataset(X, y)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=True)
```

### Training Loop

```python
# Define the loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    for inputs, targets in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}')
```

## Evaluating a Model

After training, evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy or loss. Here’s an example of evaluating a trained model:

```python
# Evaluate the model
with torch.no_grad():
    test_input = torch.tensor([[4.0, 5.0]])
    test_output = model(test_input)
    print("\nModel prediction for test input [4.0, 5.0]:")
    print(test_output)
```

## Saving and Loading Models

Saving and loading models allows you to reuse trained models without retraining.

### Saving a Model

```python
# Save the model's state_dict
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
print("\nModel saved to model.pth")
```

### Loading a Model

```python
# Create a new model instance and load the saved state_dict
model_loaded = SimpleNN()
model_loaded.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))
model_loaded.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode

# Test the loaded model
with torch.no_grad():
    test_input = torch.tensor([[6.0, 7.0]])
    test_output = model_loaded(test_input)
    print("\nModel prediction for test input [6.0, 7.0]:")
    print(test_output)
```
