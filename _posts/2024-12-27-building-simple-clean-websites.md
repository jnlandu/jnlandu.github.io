# Building Simple, Clean Websites

In an era of complex web frameworks and feature-heavy sites, there's something refreshing about returning to simplicity. Today I rebuilt my personal website with a focus on clean, minimalist design - and here's why I think that matters.

## The Problem with Complexity

Many modern websites suffer from:
- **Feature bloat** - Too many unnecessary elements and interactions
- **Slow loading times** - Heavy frameworks and excessive assets
- **Poor readability** - Cluttered layouts that distract from content
- **Maintenance overhead** - Complex systems that break easily

## The Power of Simplicity

A simple, clean website offers:

### Better User Experience
- **Fast loading** - Minimal CSS and JavaScript means quick page loads
- **Clear navigation** - Users can find what they need immediately
- **Readable content** - Typography and spacing optimized for reading
- **Mobile-friendly** - Simple layouts work naturally on all devices

### Easier Maintenance
- **Less code** - Fewer things that can break
- **Better performance** - Lightweight sites run smoothly everywhere
- **Future-proof** - Simple HTML and CSS ages well
- **Accessible** - Clean markup works better with screen readers

## Design Principles I Used

### 1. Typography First
- Choose one good font family and stick with it
- Use consistent spacing and hierarchy
- Optimize line height and text size for readability

### 2. Generous White Space
- Let content breathe
- Don't fill every pixel
- Use margins and padding effectively

### 3. Minimal Color Palette
- Start with black, white, and gray
- Add one accent color for links and highlights
- Support both light and dark modes naturally

### 4. Content-Focused Layout
- Make the content the hero
- Remove distracting elements
- Keep navigation simple and consistent

## Technical Implementation

This site uses:
- **Jekyll** for static site generation
- **Plain CSS** with CSS custom properties for theming
- **No JavaScript** for core functionality
- **Semantic HTML** for accessibility

The entire CSS file is under 300 lines and handles everything from layout to responsive design to dark mode.

## Results

The rebuilt site:
- Loads in under 1 second
- Works perfectly on mobile devices
- Automatically adapts to system dark/light mode
- Scores 100/100 on accessibility tests
- Is easy to update and maintain

## Conclusion

Sometimes the best solution is the simplest one. By focusing on content, readability, and user experience rather than trendy features, we can create websites that actually serve their purpose: communicating effectively with visitors.

The goal isn't to be boring - it's to be useful. And often, simplicity is the most useful approach of all.
