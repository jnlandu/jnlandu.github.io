# AI for Healthcare in Rural Settings

This project focuses on creating AI-powered diagnostic tools that can work effectively in rural healthcare settings with limited resources and internet connectivity.

## Problem Statement

Many rural areas in Africa lack access to specialized medical expertise, leading to delayed or incorrect diagnoses. This project aims to bridge that gap using artificial intelligence.

## Solution

Our approach includes:

- **Offline-capable AI models** that can run on basic smartphones
- **Simple, intuitive interfaces** designed for non-technical healthcare workers
- **Culturally appropriate design** that considers local contexts and practices
- **Low-resource optimization** for areas with limited power and connectivity

## Key Features

### 1. Medical Image Analysis
- Automated screening for common conditions like tuberculosis and malaria
- Integration with existing clinical workflows
- Results provided in multiple local languages

### 2. Decision Support System
- Clinical decision trees adapted for local disease patterns
- Treatment recommendations based on available resources
- Integration with local health information systems

### 3. Training and Support
- Built-in training modules for healthcare workers
- Continuous learning from local case data
- Remote support and updates when connectivity allows

## Impact

Initial pilots in three rural clinics showed:
- **40% improvement** in diagnostic accuracy
- **60% reduction** in referral times to specialist facilities
- **High acceptance rate** (85%) among healthcare workers

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, TensorFlow, Flask
- **Mobile**: React Native for cross-platform compatibility
- **AI/ML**: Computer vision models optimized for mobile deployment
- **Database**: SQLite for offline data storage

## Future Development

Plans include expanding to additional conditions, integrating telemedicine capabilities, and developing a network for sharing anonymized diagnostic data across participating clinics.
