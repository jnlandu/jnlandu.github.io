# Mathematical Optimization for Neural Architecture Search

## Project Overview

This research project develops novel mathematical optimization techniques for Neural Architecture Search (NAS), combining evolutionary algorithms with gradient-based optimization to automatically discover optimal neural network architectures for specific tasks.

## Research Contributions

- **Hybrid Optimization**: Novel combination of evolutionary and gradient-based methods

## Mathematical Framework

### Optimization Formulation
The NAS problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization:

```
minimize f(α) = [f_accuracy(α), f_latency(α), f_memory(α)]
subject to α ∈ A
```

Where α represents the architecture parameters and A is the feasible architecture space.
