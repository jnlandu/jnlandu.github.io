# NLP for African Languages: Multilingual Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project addresses the significant gap in NLP resources for African languages by developing sophisticated multilingual models for sentiment analysis. The work focuses on creating inclusive AI technologies that serve African communities in their native languages.

## Mission & Impact

### Addressing Language Inequality
- **Representation**: Supporting 10 major African languages
- **Accessibility**: Making AI technology accessible to African communities
- **Cultural Preservation**: Respecting linguistic and cultural nuances
- **Educational Impact**: Contributing to NLP research in Africa

### Supported Languages
- **East Africa**: Swahili, Amharic
- **West Africa**: Yoruba, Hausa, Wolof
- **Central Africa**: Lingala, Kikongo
- **Southern Africa**: Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans

## Technical Innovation

### Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: Multilingual BERT adapted for African languages
- **Custom Tokenization**: Specialized tokenizers for each language
- **Cross-lingual Transfer**: Leveraging knowledge across related languages
- **Fine-tuning Strategy**: Language-specific and cross-lingual fine-tuning

### Data Collection & Processing
- **Crowdsourcing**: Community-driven data collection
- **Quality Assurance**: Native speaker validation
- **Data Augmentation**: Synthetic data generation techniques
- **Ethical Considerations**: Respect for cultural context and privacy

## Key Features

### Advanced NLP Capabilities
- **Sentiment Classification**: Fine-grained emotion detection
- **Code-switching Handling**: Mixed-language text processing
- **Cultural Context**: Understanding of cultural expressions
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for deployment in resource-constrained environments

### Platform Integration
- **Web API**: RESTful API for easy integration
- **Mobile SDK**: Android/iOS libraries
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly testing platform
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides in multiple languages

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install the package
pip install african-nlp

# Quick sentiment analysis
from african_nlp import SentimentAnalyzer

analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer(language='swahili')
result = analyzer.predict("Nimefurahi sana na huduma hii!")
print(result)  # {'sentiment': 'positive', 'confidence': 0.92}
```
