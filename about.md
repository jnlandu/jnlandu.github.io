# About Me


## Background

Hi, I'm **Jeremie Nlandu Mabiala**, an AI Engineer and researcher currently pursuing my master's degree at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) in Senegal.

I am **{{ site.firstName }} {{ site.lastName }}**, an AI researcher and mathematician passionate about the theoretical foundations of machine learning and their practical applications. If you're from an English-speaking culture, you can call me Jeremy.

## Background

## Education

I specialize in:

### Current Studies- **Machine Learning** - Developing intelligent systems and algorithms

- **Student in Artificial Intelligence** at the [African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI)](https://aimsammi.org/)- **Computer Vision** - Image processing and pattern recognition

- A pan-African master's program in Artificial Intelligence founded by Google and Meta- **Mathematical Modeling** - Applied mathematics for real-world problems

- Hosted at AIMS Senegal- **Natural Language Processing** - Working with African languages and multilingual systems



### Previous Education## Education

- **Master's degree in Mathematical Sciences** (February 2024)

  - [Stellenbosch University](https://www.sun.ac.za) and [AIMS South Africa](https://aims.ac.za)- **Master's in Mathematical Sciences** - AIMS Senegal (Current)

  - Specialized in Mathematical Statistics and Functional Data Analysis- Focus on AI applications for African contexts

  - Master's thesis: *"Gaussian Processes for Multivariate Functional Data"*

  - Available at the [AIMS Archive](https://archive.aims.ac.za/)## Research Interests



- **Bachelor's degree in Mathematics** (Bac +6 equivalent)My research focuses on developing AI solutions that address real challenges in Africa, particularly in:

  - [University of Kinshasa](https://unikin.ac.cd), Congo's leading university- Healthcare AI systems for resource-limited settings

  - Graduated as the best student in the department with "Grande Distinction" (Summa Cum Laude equivalent)- Agricultural technology and precision farming

  - Served as teaching assistant and subsidiary lecturer for two years- Educational technology and personalized learning

- Multilingual NLP for African languages

## Research Interests

## Mission

My research focuses on several interconnected areas:

I'm passionate about building the future of AI in Africa - creating technology that is inclusive, culturally-aware, and addresses the unique challenges and opportunities across the continent.

### Primary Interests

- **Theoretical Aspects of Machine Learning and Deep Learning**: Understanding the mathematical foundations that make these systems work## Connect

- **Functional Data Analysis**: Mathematical statistics applied to functional data, with a focus on Gaussian processes

- **Large Language Models**: Natural language processing and the development of more capable language models- **Email**: [jeremie@aims.ac.za](mailto:jeremie@aims.ac.za)

- **GitHub**: [github.com/jnlandu](https://github.com/jnlandu)

### Secondary Interests- **LinkedIn**: [linkedin.com/in/jeremie-nlandu-mabiala-aa3a1b1b](https://linkedin.com/in/jeremie-nlandu-mabiala-aa3a1b1b)

- **Mathematical Modeling**: Applying mathematical techniques to solve real-world problems
- **Computer Vision**: Visual recognition systems and image analysis
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Decision-making algorithms and their applications

## Teaching & Mentorship

I am passionate about teaching and knowledge sharing, a trait I inherited from my father and grandfather, who were both teachers. I believe in:

- Making complex mathematical concepts accessible
- Bridging the gap between theory and practice
- Mentoring the next generation of researchers
- Contributing to the African AI research community

## Beyond Research

When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy:

- **Software Development**: Building tools and applications as a hobbyist developer
- **Writing**: Working on various writing projects and poetry
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Contributing to open-source projects and writing about AI/ML topics
